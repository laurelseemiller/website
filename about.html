<h2>About</h2>


<p>
  I am a postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="https://www.crowley-lab.org/" target="_none">Crowley Lab</a> in the Department of Biology and the Center for Neural Engineering at Penn State University. I am interested in how exposure to alcohol or other stressors during adolescence has long-term consequences on brain function and behavior. </p>

  My experience in biological research began as an undergraduate researcher <a href="https://www.susqu.edu/academics/centers-and-programs/freshwater-research-institute/" target="_none"> studying fish populations in the Susquehanna River</a>. After working on experiments investigating fish behavior, I became interested in understanding the biological bases of behavior. I then completed external research experiences in neurobiology at the <a href="https://neuroanatomie.charite.de/" target="_none"> Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin</a> and behavioral neuroscience at the <a href="https://med.uc.edu/" target="_none"> University of Cincinnati</a>. These experiences, in addition to my thesis project in developmental neurobiology, solidified my passion for neuroscience. </p>

  As a graduate student, I studied how genetic background and adolescent age impacted cognition and addiction-related behaviors in preclinical models. My dissertation work investigated genetic differences between inbred mouse strains that contributed to differences in susceptibility to cognitive deficits due to alcohol during adolescence, which was supported in part by a NIGMS T32 Fellowship in Physiological Adaptations to Stress. As a postdoctoral fellow, I am continuing this work by characterizing biological and behavioral deficits seen in adulthood after adolescent alcohol consumption. Specifically, I am using electrophysiology and behavioral genetics to study how the prefrontal somatostatin system is disrupted by adolescent alcohol, which is supported by a <a href="https://science.psu.edu/news/laurel-seemiller-awarded-nih-kirschstein-nrsa-postdoctoral-fellowship" target="_none">NIAAA F32 fellowship</a>. </p>

</p>
  To summarize, I am a postdoctoral fellow with training in behavioral pharmacology and genetics and electrophysiology. I am interested in continuing this work to broadly understand how alcohol exposure and other stressors can disrupt normal development. </p>

  Outside of work, I like rock climbing and cooking. </p>
