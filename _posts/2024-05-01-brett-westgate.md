We've been interested in respiration in the lab for some time now, and are looking for a more accurate measure of respiration than thermocouples can allow for. Further, we need it to be compatible with our two-photon microscope setup, which is challenging. Over the past year, undergrad Brett Westgate set out to design and build an acoustic plethysmograph to do exactly that. The plethysmograph was based on an original design done in the 00s by [Reynolds and Frazer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16897419) out of West Virginia.

Brett has completed prototyping, and is on the job market! [Check out our work on his website.](https://brettwestgate.wixsite.com/westgateprojects/portfolio)
